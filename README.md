# Damyon's Web Service Project
Web service project for Eleos Technologies.
## TO DO LIST
- [X] Decide on a language / framework [JavaScript/Node.js]
- [ ] Get a boilerplate server running
- [ ] Implement endpoints:
  - [ ] (POST) **Login**
    - [ ] Takes in a username/password
    - [ ] Returns a user object and a token to be used for verification
    - [ ] 
  - [ ] (GET) **Verifies**
    - [ ] Use token recieved from **Login** to verify periodically as the user uses the app and ensures that they should still be logged in. Instead of a user/pass it sends a token
